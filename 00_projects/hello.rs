     * This is another type of comment, a block comment. In general,
     * line comments are the recommended comment style. But
     * block comments are extremely useful for temporarily disabling
     * chunks of code. /* Block comments can be /* nested, */ */
     * so it takes only a few keystrokes to comment out everything
     * in this main() function. /*/*/* Try it yourself! */*/*/

    Note: The previous column of `*` was entirely for style. There's
    no actual need for it.

    // You can manipulate expressions more easily with block comments
    // than with line comments. Try deleting the comment delimiters
    // to change the result:

    // Without a suffix, 31 becomes an i32. You can change what type 31 is
    // by providing a suffix. The number 31i64 for example has the type i64.

    // There are various optional patterns this works with. Positional
    // arguments can be used.
    println!("{0}, this is {1}. {1}, this is {0}", "Alice", "Bob");
